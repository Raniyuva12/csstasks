        On his deathbed, Aldous Huxley reflected on his entire life’s learning and then summed it up in seven simple words: “Let us be kinder to one another.”All too often, we believe that in order to live a truly fulfilling life we must achieve some great act or grand feat that will put us on the front covers of magazines andnewspapers. Nothing could be further from the truth. A meaningful life is made up of a series of daily acts of <u>decency and kindness</u>, which, ironically, add up tosomething truly great over the course of a lifetime Everyone who enters your life has a lesson to teach and a story to tell. Every person you pass during the moments that make up your days represents an opportunity to show a little more of the compassion and courtesy that define your humanity. Why not start being more of the person you truly are during your days and doing what you can to enrich the world around you? In my mind, if you make even<i>one person smile </i>during your day or brighten the mood of even one stranger, your day has been a worthwhile one.<mark>kindness</mark>,quite simply, is the rent we must pay for the space we occupy on this planet. Become more creative in the ways you show compassion to strangers.Paying the toll for the person in the car behind you, offering your seat on the subway to someone in need and being the first to say hello are great places tostart. Recently, I received a letter from a reader of The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari who lives in <bold>Washington State</bold>. In it she wrote: “I have a practice of tithing to people who have helped me along my spiritual path. Please accept the enclosed check of $100 with my blessing and gratitude.” I quickly responded to her generous act by sending one of my audiotape programs in return so she received value for the gift she sent me. Her gesture was a great lesson in the importance of giving sincerely and from the heart.

            The way you begin your day determines the way you will live your day. I call the first thirty minutes after you wake up <q>The Platinum 30</q> since they are truly the most valuable moments of your day and have a profound influence on the quality of every minute that follows. If you have the wisdom and self-discipline to ensure that, during this key period, you think only the purest of thoughts and take only the finest of actions, you will notice that your days will consistently unfold in the most marvelous ways. Recently, I took my two young children to see the thrilling IMAX movie Everest. Aside from the <i>breathtaking imagery</i> and the powerful acts of heroism portrayed, there was one point that stayed with me: in order for the mountainclimbers to scale the summit, it was essential for them to have a good base camp. It was impossible for them to get to the top without that camp at the bottom that offered them a sanctuary for rest, renewal and replenishing. Once they reached Camp Two, they then returned to the base for a few weeks to recharge their batteries. On reaching Camp Three, they hastily retreated to base camp to prepare for the trek to Camp Four. And on reaching Camp Four, they again went back down the mountain to base camp before making their final push for the summit. In the same way, I think that every one of us, in order to reach our personal summits and master the daily challenges of our own lives, needs to revisit our base camps during “The Platinum 30.” We need to go to a place where we can reconnect to our <u>life’s mission</u>l, renew our selves and refocus on the things that matter most. In my own life, I have developed a very effective morning ritual that consistently gets my day off to a joyful and peace-filled start. After waking, Ihead down to my “personal sanctuary,” a little space I have created for myself where I can practice my renewal activities without being disturbed. I then spend about fifteen minutes in silent contemplation, focusing on all the good things in my life and envisioning the day that I expect is about to unfold. Next I pick up a book from the wisdom literature, one rich with those timeless truths of successful living that are so easy to forget in these fast-paced times we live in Examples include Meditations by the Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius, The Autobiography of<mark> Benjamin Franklin and Walden by Henry David Thoreau</mark>. The lessons in these works center me on the things that truly count and help launch my day on the right footing. And the wisdom I read during that precious early morning period infuses and enlightens every remaining minute of my day. So start your day well. You will never be the same.

            I’ll make you this promise: on your deathbed, in the twilight of your life, it will not be all the risks you took that you will regret the most. Rather, what will fill your heart with the greatest amount of<del>regret and sadness </del> will be all those risks that you did not take, all those opportunities you did not seize and all those fears  you did not face. Remember that on the other side of fear lies freedom. And stay focused on the timeless success principle that says: “life is nothing more that a game of numbers—the more risks you take, the more rewards you will receive.”  Or in the words of Sophocles,<q>Fortune is not on the side of the faint-hearted</q>  To live your life to the fullest, start taking more risks and doing the things  you fear. Get good at being uncomfortable and stop walking the path of least  resistance. Sure, there is a greater chance you will stub your toes when you walk the road less traveled, but that is the only way you can get anywhere. As my wise mother always says, “you cannot get to third base with one foot on second.”Or as André Gide observed, “One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.”
            <br>
            The real secret to a life of abundance is to stop spending your days searching for security and to start spending your time pursuing opportunity.  Sure, you will meet with your share of failures if you start living more deliberately and passionately. But failure is nothing more than learning how to  win. Or as my dad observed one day, “Robin, it’s risky out on a limb. But that’s where all the fruit is.” As I wrote in an earlier lesson, life is all about choices. Deeply fulfilled and highly actualized people simply make wiser choices than others. You can choose  to spend the rest of your days sitting on the shore of life in complete safety or you can take some chances, dive deep into the water and discover the pearls that lie waiting for the person of true courage. To keep me inspired and centered on the fact that I must keep stretching my own <i>personal boundaries </i> the days go  by, I have posted the following words of<mark> Theodore Roosevelt </mark> the study whereI write: It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The  credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,<em> who strives valiantly</em>, who errs and comes short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, atleast fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat

            Norman Cousins once noted that “The Tragedy of life is not death, but what welet die inside of us while we live.” In a similar vein, Ashley Montagu wrote that“The deepest personal defeat suffered by human beings is constituted by thedifference between what one was capable of becoming and what one has in factbecome.” There is a difference between simply existing and truly living. There isa distinction between <q>simply surviving and really thriving</q>. The sad thing is that most people have lost sight of the human gifts that lie within them and haveresigned themselves to spending the best years of their lives watching televisionin a subdivision.In my speeches, I often use the following story drawn from ancient Indianmythology to remind the audience that there is an abundance of potential andability just waiting to be awakened within us if we will only allow it to see thelight of day. Thousands of years ago, it was believed that everyone who walkedthe earth was a <mark>god</mark>. But humankind abused its limitless powers so the supremegod decided to hide the godhead, the source of all of this potential, so that no onecould find it. The qustion then became, where could such a thing be hidden?The first adviser suggested it could be placed deep in the ground to which the supreme god replied, “No, eventually someone will dig deep enough and findit.” The second adviser then offered, “What if we place the godhead at thebottom of the deepest ocean” to which the supreme god responded, “No,eventually someone will dive deep enough and find it.” The third adviser thencimed in, “Well, why don’t we put it on the top of the highest mountain?” which prompted the supreme god to reply, “No, I’m certain that eventuallysomeone will scale that highest of peaks and find it.” 
<br>After reflecting for sometime, the supreme god found the solution: “I will put this source of all humanpower, potential and purpose inside the hearts of every man, woman and childon the planet, for they will never think to look there.”In all my work with employees of organizations across <i>North America</i>, Isee the same thing: too many people spend more time focusing on theirweaknesses rather than developing their strengths. By concentrating on whatthey don’t have, they neglect the talents they do have. The greatest people whohave gone before us all had a simple strategy that ensured their success: they knew themselves. They made the time to reflect on their core abilities—thosespecial qualities that made them unique—and spent the rest of their lives refiningand expanding them. You see, we are all endowed with the capacity for genius.Perhaps you have just not taken the time to discover what your personal gifts areand then honed them to the level where you are considered brilliant.Are you using the best within you to its fullest capacity? If not, you are notonly doing yourself a disservice, you are doing the world, and all those within itwho could benefit from your unique talents, a disservice. Ruskin put it this way,“The weakest among us has a gift, however seemingly trivial, which is peculiar to him and which worthily used will be a gift also to his race.”
